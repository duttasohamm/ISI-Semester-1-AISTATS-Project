# ISI-Semester-1-AISTATS-Project
This repository contains the (pseudo)code for the AISTATS Project as a part of the coursework for the First Semester in the B.Stat Degree at ISI Kolkata.
The pseudocode has been uploaded under the name "Computer Project Pseudocode.py".

The code we have submitted is not entirely complete and we haven't been able to implement all the algorithms which have been stated in the paper. We haven't been able to decipher the paper in its entirety and hence our work is still not fully complete. However, we aim to first understand the paper and then ultimately implement the entire code.
